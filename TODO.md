# TTL Conditional Triggering Plugin - To-Do List

* Make a companion widget that reads integer-valued codes and converts them
to boolean values to feed to this widget. This could be set up as a detector
or set up as a demultiplexer (each output recognizes a number and only the
most recently recognized is active within a group of outputs).

* Maybe make inputs disable themselves if input channel and bit aren't valid.

* Respond to clicking output labels the same way as clicking output tab
buttons.
