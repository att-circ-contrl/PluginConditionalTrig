# TTL Conditional Triggering Plugin - To-Do List

* Configuration via event code input would be useful for v5. For v6,
configuration via broadcast messages is cleaner.

* Being able to recognize integer input values might be handy. The cleanest
way to do this is to make a separate widget that uses a comparison to
convert them to boolean values, which could feed this widget.

* Perhaps split out the circular buffer into a separate library?

* Perhaps make a more general "read from this image array" base class for
the wrench icon, for ease of extension?

* Perhaps split out the icons into a separate library?

* Bug: For some reason, _without_ a source upstream of it, clicking on output enable/disable icons doesn't work. But with a source, it does.
